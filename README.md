## The Problem

Financial data in institutions is often trapped in complex spreadsheets, dense PDFs, and siloed departments. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to track the flow of money, creates opportunities for misuse, and leaves stakeholders like citizens, students, and donors completely in the dark. How can we trust numbers that are hard to access, difficult to understand, and impossible to verify?

## Our Solution: The "Crystl" Ecosystem

Crystl tackles this problem with a three-pronged approach: **Automate**, **Verify**, and **Visualize**. We built a comprehensive platform with distinct, tailored experiences for every stakeholder.

### Key Features Implemented

#### ü§ñ 1. AI-Powered Data Ingestion Engine
We eliminated the #1 barrier to transparency: manual data entry. Our intelligent pipeline automates the entire process.
- **Upload Anything:** Institutions can upload raw financial documents as **CSVs or even unstructured PDFs**.
- **Intelligent Structuring:** We use **Google Cloud Vision API** for OCR and the **Gemini LLM** to intelligently parse documents, identify transactions, and structure messy data into a clean, usable format.
- **Automated Routing:** The structured data is then routed to the correct departments for verification.

#### üìä 2. Advanced Analytics & Visualization Suite
Data is useless if you can't understand it. Our public-facing dashboards turn complex numbers into intuitive stories.
- **Multi-Level Fund Flow:** Interactive **Sankey diagrams** visualize the complete journey of funds from the institution down to the final vendor.
- **Spending Breakdowns:** **Pie and Bar charts** provide instant insights into spending by department and track trends over time.
- **Granular Transaction Log:** A fully searchable and paginated table provides ultimate detail.

#### ‚úÖ 3. Two-Party Verification Workflow
To ensure data accuracy, nothing is accepted blindly.
- **Pending Approvals:** Allocations created by an institution appear in the respective department's dashboard as "pending".
- **Approve or Dispute:** Departments must digitally approve every transaction, creating a human-level check and balance.
